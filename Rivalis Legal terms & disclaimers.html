                    <p>Information disclosed during an initial consultation, while treated with appropriate care and discretion, does not create an attorney-client relationship or attorney-client privilege unless and until you are formally engaged as a client through a signed engagement letter.</p>

                    <h3>Capacity Limitations</h3>
                    <p>Rivalis Law maintains limited client capacity to ensure personalized, high-quality service. Not all prospective clients will be accepted for representation. Factors considered in accepting new clients include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current workload and capacity constraints</li>
                        <li>Nature and complexity of the legal matter</li>
                        <li>Potential conflicts of interest</li>
                        <li>Geographic and jurisdictional considerations</li>
                        <li>Alignment of matter with firm expertise and practice areas</li>
                        <li>Resource requirements and timing considerations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Note:</strong> Declining to accept representation does not reflect on the merit of your matter. It may simply indicate capacity constraints, jurisdictional limitations, or practice area focus.

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Jurisdictional Limitations</h3>
                    <p>An attorney's ability to practice law is generally limited to jurisdictions where the attorney is licensed. The following principles apply:</p>

                    <h4>New York Practice</h4>
                    <p>Attorney Aeron is authorized to practice law in New York State, including providing legal advice on matters governed by New York law and representing clients in New York state and federal courts where admitted.</p>

                    <h4>Michigan Practice</h4>
                    <p>Attorney Aeron is authorized to practice law in Michigan, including providing legal advice on matters governed by Michigan law and representing clients in Michigan state and federal courts where admitted.</p>

                    <h4>Federal Practice</h4>
                    <p>Admission to practice before federal agencies and courts is generally separate from state bar admission. Federal practice authority includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Immigration Matters:</strong> Authorized to practice before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and immigration courts nationwide pursuant to federal immigration law</li>
                        <li><strong>Federal Courts:</strong> Admitted to practice before specific federal district courts and may seek pro hac vice admission in other federal courts as needed</li>
                        <li><strong>Federal Agencies:</strong> May represent clients before federal administrative agencies as authorized by agency rules</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Multi-Jurisdictional Practice</h4>
                    <p>Certain legal services may be provided to clients in jurisdictions where the attorney is not admitted, consistent with applicable multi-jurisdictional practice rules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Matters arising under federal law (e.g., federal immigration law, federal securities law)</li>
                        <li>Transactional matters involving multiple jurisdictions</li>
                        <li>Services provided in association with local counsel admitted in the relevant jurisdiction</li>
                        <li>Temporary services permitted under ABA Model Rule 5.5 and similar state rules</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>UAE and International Matters</h3>
                    <p>References to "UAE markets" or United Arab Emirates practice on this website refer to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Advising U.S.-based clients on U.S. legal matters related to UAE business activities</li>
                        <li>U.S. immigration services for UAE nationals seeking U.S. visas</li>
                        <li>Cross-border transactional support involving both U.S. and UAE entities, focusing on U.S. law aspects</li>
                        <li>Coordination with UAE-licensed legal counsel on international matters</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <strong>Important:</strong> Rivalis Law is not licensed to practice UAE law or represent clients in UAE courts. For matters requiring UAE legal advice or representation, local UAE-licensed counsel must be engaged, and Rivalis Law can assist in coordinating such representation.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Pro Hac Vice Admissions</h3>
                    <p>For litigation matters in jurisdictions where Attorney Aeron is not admitted, pro hac vice admission may be sought where permissible under local court rules, typically in association with local counsel.</p>

                    <h3>Professional Affiliations</h3>
                    <p>Attorney Aeron maintains memberships in the following professional organizations:</p>

                        <li>Scope of representation and specific matters covered</li>
                        <li>Matters explicitly excluded from the engagement</li>
                        <li>Fee structure, billing rates, and payment terms</li>
                        <li>Estimated costs and expense reimbursement policies</li>
                        <li>Communication protocols and response times</li>
                        <li>Responsibilities of both the attorney and the client</li>
                        <li>Termination provisions</li>
                        <li>Dispute resolution procedures</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Scope of Representation</h3>
                    <p>Unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing, legal representation is limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The specific matter(s) described in the engagement letter</li>
                        <li>The time period specified in the engagement agreement</li>
                        <li>The jurisdictions in which the attorney is licensed or authorized to practice</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Limited Scope Representation:</strong> Many engagements are for limited scope or "unbundled" legal services, meaning the attorney provides specific services rather than full representation in all aspects of a matter. The engagement letter will clearly define the scope.

                    <h3>Termination of Representation</h3>
                    <p>Either the client or attorney may terminate the attorney-client relationship:</p>

                    <h4>Client-Initiated Termination</h4>
                    <p>Clients have the right to terminate representation at any time, with or without cause. Upon termination:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client must provide written notice of termination</li>
                        <li>Client remains responsible for fees and costs incurred up to termination date</li>
                        <li>Attorney will provide reasonable assistance with transition to new counsel</li>
                        <li>Client files and property will be returned upon payment of outstanding fees (subject to applicable rules and retaining lien rights)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Attorney-Initiated Termination</h4>
                    <p>The attorney may withdraw from representation for reasons permitted under professional conduct rules, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client's failure to pay fees or costs as agreed</li>
                        <li>Client's failure to cooperate or follow advice</li>
                        <li>Client's use of services to further crime or fraud</li>
                        <li>Representation that would violate rules of professional conduct</li>
                        <li>Unreasonable difficulty in working relationship</li>
                        <li>Client's termination of necessary decision-making capacity</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In litigation matters, withdrawal may require court approval. The attorney will take reasonable steps to protect client interests during any withdrawal process.</p>

                    <h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>
                    <p>Before accepting any engagement, Rivalis Law conducts a thorough conflicts of interest check. Representation may be declined if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A direct conflict exists with a current or former client</li>
                        <li>Representation would be materially limited by attorney's responsibilities to another client or third party</li>
                        <li>Representation would involve asserting a claim against a current client in a different matter</li>
                        <li>Personal interests of the attorney conflict with client interests</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In some situations, conflicts may be waived with informed written consent of all affected parties. The engagement letter will address any potential conflicts and required waivers.</p>

                    <h3>Duty of Confidentiality</h3>

                    <h3>Attorney-Client Privilege</h3>
